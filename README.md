## üîê Closed-Source Software

### üßå NedTroll
A Python program that opens a window. If you try to close it, another one will appear. This repeats endlessly.  
This was made as a joke/demo to explore process handling and window management in Python.

To stop it:
- **Linux**: use `xkill` or a similar tool
- **Windows**: use Task Manager

- number of repetitions

Version 2 includes a better GUI and more features. Press `ESC` during spam to stop the process.

‚ö†Ô∏è **This tool was created as a technical demo. Do not use it to spam real systems, people, or services.**

### ü§ñ NedGrab
A basic macro that simulates key presses by repeatedly typing a chosen letter.  
Created to learn about keyboard automation in Python.  
It is a simple proof-of-concept, not a production-grade tool.
